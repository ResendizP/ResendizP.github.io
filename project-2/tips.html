            <div> <p class="sub-titles-caretips"> 
               Light: 
            </p> <p class="little-paragraphs">Direct (bright): Full sunlight for 6+ hours per day.<br>
                Indirect (partial): Diffuse sunlight for 3-6 hours of the day. Avoid direct sunlight.<br>
                Low (shade): Generally only needed every 1-2 weeks during the “growing months” = spring and summer. A liquid variety works well for most indoor plants. <br>
                Tip: “full shade” does not mean a plant can survive in a windowless room. All plants require sunlight! </p> </div>
                <div>
                <p class="sub-titles-caretips"> 
                    Watering: 
                 </p> <p class="little-paragraphs">Low: once every 2 weeks, or when most of the soil is dry. <br>
                    Moderate: once a week, or when first 1-2 inches of top soil has dried out. <br>
                    High: 2-3 times a week, when top soil has dried out. Misting: use to produce humidity and to help clean the leaves.
                    <br>
                    Tip:Water more often in the summer and water less often in the winter. </p></div>

                Maintenance: 
            </p> <p class="little-paragraphs">Humidity: some tropical plants do will when the leaves are misted. <br>
                Leaf care: Wipe both side of leaves with a soft damp cloth monthly. Prune away leaves that are yellowed, browned, or withering. <br>
                Fertilizer: Generally only needed every 1-2 weeks during the “growing months” spring and summer. A liquid variety works well for most indoor plants.  </p> </div>

                    Plants love CONSISTENCY! 
                 </p> <p class="little-paragraphs">Consistency in: Frequency of watering, temperature, feeding of fertilizer, amount of watering, light and humidity.</p></div>
