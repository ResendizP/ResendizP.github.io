        <h2>Bromeliad</h2>
        <h3>Exotic flowering bracts, strappy leaves, jungle vibe: bromeliads make gorgeous houseplants.</h3>
        <p>Bromeliads add instant color and a decidedly tropical vibe to any room. These exotic jungle plants can grow happily inside your home with the right care. There are actually many different species that fall into the bromeliad family. Each has its own look, with flowering bracts in many different shapes and colors. Their leaves vary too -- some are thick and strappy and others are grass-like. Each is dramatic in its own right. Since many bromeliads are epiphytes, they donâ€™t need soil to grow in; some can be attached to posts or grown in moss baskets. But they do love moisture and humidity. Take care not to allow their bases to get soggy; plants can rot if their feet are too wet. Bromeliads make great low-maintenance indoor plants as they don't require much sun and only need to be watered about once a week when kept indoors. As bromedliads love humidity, be sure to keep them away from air conditioning and cold draughts and mist with a spray bottle every couple of days.</p>
